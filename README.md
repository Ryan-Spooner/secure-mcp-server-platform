The Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP) project is dedicated to advancing the understanding and application of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our mission is twofold:
1.  **Educational Empowerment:** To provide comprehensive resources, examples, and tutorials that enable developers to master MCP, build robust MCP servers, and integrate them effectively.
2.  **Platform Foundation:** To evolve into an open-source platform featuring a curated MCP Server Catalog and tools for creating containerized AI systems leveraging MCP.

SMCP is an initiative born from the [Dynamous AI Community](https://dynamous.ai), fostering open protocols and open-source solutions.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification designed to facilitate standardized communication and context exchange between AI models, agents, and other components within an AI system. It aims to improve interoperability and simplify the development of complex AI applications.

## SMCP Project Goals

*   **Deepen Understanding:** Provide clear explanations and practical examples of MCP at the protocol level.
*   **Facilitate MCP Server Development:** Offer templates, guides, and best practices for creating custom MCP servers.
*   **Enable Effective Troubleshooting:** Equip developers with the knowledge to diagnose and resolve common MCP integration issues.
*   **Foster an Open Ecosystem:** Build a community-driven catalog of MCP servers and tools.

## Getting Started (Educational Focus)

Our initial focus is on building out the educational aspects of SMCP. You'll find resources to help you:

*   Explore a **Universal MCP Example** (client/server) to see MCP in action. (Link to be added)
*   Utilize **Project Templates** to kickstart your own MCP server or client development. (Link to be added)
*   Dive into our tutorials:
    *   **MCP Troubleshooting Guide** (Link to be added)
    *   **Creating a Custom MCP Server** (Link to be added)

*(More details on repository structure and running examples will be added here.)*

## Future Vision: The SMCP Platform

Beyond education, SMCP aims to become a comprehensive platform including:

*   **MCP Server Catalog/Marketplace:** A curated, searchable directory of publicly available and community-contributed MCP servers.
*   **Containerized AI System Creator:** An agentic system to help users design and generate container-based AI systems that orchestrate MCP servers, AI agents, and RAG pipelines.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's improving documentation, adding examples, submitting MCP server details for the catalog, or helping develop the platform, your input is valuable.
