# JavaScript MCP Client Template

*This directory provides a boilerplate template for creating a new MCP client using JavaScript (e.g., for Node.js or browser environments).*

## Purpose

This template aims to accelerate the development of custom MCP clients by providing:
*   A basic client structure.
*   Functions for connecting to an MCP server and handling the MCP handshake.
*   Examples of how to send commands and receive/process responses.
*   Clear "TODO" markers for areas requiring customization.

## How to Use This Template

1.  **Copy this directory** to your new project location.
2.  **Review the `TODO` comments** in the code and update the implementations for your specific client logic.
    *   Define the MCP commands your client needs to send.
    *   Implement the logic for handling responses from the server.
    *   Integrate with your application's UI or other systems as needed.
3.  **Install dependencies** (e.g., using `package.json`).
4.  **Run and test** your new client against an MCP server.

## Key Files (Example Structure)

*   `main.js` or `client.js`: Main application entry point or client library.
*   `mcp_connection.js`: Logic for establishing and managing the MCP connection.
*   `command_sender.js`: Functions for constructing and sending MCP commands.
*   `response_handler.js`: Logic for parsing and acting on server responses.
*   `package.json`: Node.js project manifest and dependencies (if applicable).

*(Placeholder JavaScript files for the client template will be added here later.)*
