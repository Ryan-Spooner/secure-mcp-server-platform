# Python MCP Server Template

*This directory provides a boilerplate template for creating a new MCP server using Python.*

## Purpose

This template aims to accelerate the development of custom MCP servers by providing:
*   A basic server structure.
*   Placeholder implementations for core MCP functionalities (handshake, command handling).
*   Clear "TODO" markers for areas requiring customization.
*   Recommendations for libraries and best practices.

## How to Use This Template

1.  **Copy this directory** to your new project location.
2.  **Rename the main project files/modules** as needed.
3.  **Review the `TODO` comments** in the code and update the implementations for your specific server logic.
    *   Define your server's capabilities and supported MCP commands.
    *   Implement the logic for each command.
    *   Set up any necessary state management or data persistence.
4.  **Install dependencies** (e.g., using `requirements.txt` if provided, or add your own).
5.  **Run and test** your new server.

## Key Files (Example Structure)

*   `main.py` or `server.py`: Main application entry point.
*   `mcp_handler.py`: Logic for handling MCP connections, parsing messages, and dispatching commands.
*   `commands/`: Directory for individual command processor modules.
*   `config.py`: Server configuration.
*   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

*(Placeholder Python files for the server template will be added here later, e.g., using FastAPI or a simple socket server approach.)*
