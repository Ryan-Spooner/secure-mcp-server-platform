## Current Focus
*   Planning and initiating content development for the SMCP Educational Toolkit. This includes populating:
    *   `docs/tutorials/` (mcp-basics, mcp-troubleshooting, creating-custom-mcp-server).
    *   `examples/universal-mcp-showcase/` (client and server implementations and READMEs).
    *   `project-templates/` (Python server and JavaScript client templates with code and READMEs).

## Recent Significant Changes (Last 1-2 sessions)
*   Created initial project file and directory structure to prepare for public access and community contributions. This includes:
    *   Root files: `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`.
    *   `docs/` directory with `CONTRIBUTING.md` (existing), `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (existing), and placeholders for `tutorials/mcp-basics.md`, `tutorials/mcp-troubleshooting.md`, `tutorials/creating-custom-mcp-server.md`.
    *   `examples/universal-mcp-showcase/` with placeholder `README.md` files for the showcase and its `client/` and `server/` subdirectories.
    *   `project-templates/` with placeholder `README.md` files for `python-mcp-server-template/` and `javascript-mcp-client-template/`.
*   Aligned all `memory-bank` files and `draft.windsurfrules` (now `.windsurfrules`) with SMCP project goals.

## Open Questions / Blockers / Issues
*   None currently.

## Next Immediate Step(s)
*   Begin development of the first planned task, likely starting with `docs/tutorials/mcp-basics.md` or one of the example/template READMEs, as directed by the user.
