## SMCP Mission
* **Educational Empowerment:** To provide comprehensive resources, examples, and tutorials that enable developers to master MCP, build robust MCP servers, and integrate them effectively.
* **Platform Foundation:** To evolve into an open-source platform featuring a curated MCP Server Catalog and tools for creating containerized AI systems leveraging MCP.

## Core Principles
* **Open Protocols & FOSS:** Commitment to open standards and free, open-source software.
* **Robust Security:** Prioritizing secure design and practices in all components and recommendations.
* **Community Driven:** Fostering a collaborative environment for learning, contribution, and innovation.

## Key Features & Deliverables
*   **Educational Toolkit:**
    *   Universal MCP Showcase (client/server example).
    *   Project Templates (Python MCP Server, JS Client, etc.).
    *   Tutorials (MCP Troubleshooting, Custom MCP Server Creation).
    *   Living Documentation.
*   **SMCP Platform (Future Vision):**
    *   MCP Server Catalog/Marketplace.
    *   Containerized AI System Creator (Agentic System).
    *   Archon Integration Strategy.
    *   SecureG PKI-as-a-Service Integration.

## Target Audience
* AI Developers, ML Engineers, System Architects.
* Individuals and organizations looking to understand, build, or integrate with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## High-Level Architecture Overview (Conceptual)
*   **Educational Resources:** Hosted in a structured GitHub repository (e.g., `smcp-docs-and-examples`).
*   **MCP Server Catalog:** Database-backed (e.g., PostgreSQL) with a RESTful API for submissions and queries.
*   **Agentic System Creator:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, template-driven, generating containerized outputs (Docker, Compose).
