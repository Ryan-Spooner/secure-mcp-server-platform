## [2025-05-08] - Decision: Use the file-based memory-bank system for AI context management.

*   **Decision:** Use the file-based memory-bank system for AI context management.
*   **Rationale:** Provides structured, persistent context across sessions. Separates concerns clearly. Aligns with Windsurf Editor capabilities.
*   **Context/Trigger:** Project initialization requiring a defined context mechanism for the AI assistant.
*   **Implementation Notes:** Core files created during initialization. Rules defined in .windsurfrules v1.1. Update strategies specified (APPEND, REPLACE_SECTION).

## [2025-05-08] - Decision: Alignment of `draft.windsurfrules` and `memory-bank` with SMCP

*   **Decision:** Align `draft.windsurfrules` and `memory-bank` files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) with SMCP project goals and principles.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Ensures all guiding documents consistently reflect the SMCP mission, features, and operational strategies from the outset.
    *   Provides a clear and accurate context for AI assistance and future development.
*   **Context/Trigger:**
    *   User request to review and revise project documentation to align with SMCP, following initial project setup.
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   Updated `initial_content_templates` in `draft.windsurfrules` for `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `progress.md`.
    *   Changed `update_strategy` for `productContext.md` in `draft.windsurfrules` to `REPLACE_SECTION`.
    *   Replaced content of `memory-bank/productContext.md` with its new SMCP-aligned template.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to reflect current file revision tasks.
    *   Replaced content of `memory-bank/progress.md` with its new SMCP-aligned template and updated task status.
*   **Timestamp:** 2025-05-08 08:48:00

## [2025-05-08] - Decision: Initial Project File and Directory Structure

*   **Decision:** Adopted a standard open-source project structure to prepare for public access and community contributions, aligning with `README.md` and `projectBrief.md`.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Provides immediate clarity for new contributors and users.
    *   Establishes placeholders for planned educational content (tutorials, examples) and project templates as outlined in `projectBrief.md` and `README.md`.
    *   Includes essential files like `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for governance and community standards.
    *   Organizes content logically into `docs/`, `examples/`, and `project-templates/`.
*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   A flatter structure: Rejected as less scalable for growing content.
    *   A more deeply nested structure initially: Rejected as overly complex for the current stage.
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   Created `LICENSE` (MIT).
    *   Created `.gitignore` (common ignores).
    *   Verified/created `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
    *   Created `docs/tutorials/mcp-basics.md`, `docs/tutorials/mcp-troubleshooting.md`, `docs/tutorials/creating-custom-mcp-server.md` (placeholders).
    *   Created `examples/universal-mcp-showcase/` with `README.md` and `client/README.md`, `server/README.md` (placeholders).
    *   Created `project-templates/` with `python-mcp-server-template/README.md` and `javascript-mcp-client-template/README.md` (placeholders).
*   **Affected Components:** Entire repository structure.
*   **Follow-up Actions:** Populate placeholder files with content; update main `README.md` to link to new resources once content is more mature.
*   **Timestamp:** 2025-05-08 09:42:00  *(Updated to reflect actual time of structural completion)*
