# Universal MCP Showcase

*This directory contains a simple, universal example of an MCP client and server interacting. It's designed to demonstrate core MCP concepts in action.*

## Overview

*   **Client:** (Located in `client/`) - A basic client that can connect to the MCP server, send commands, and display responses.
*   **Server:** (Located in `server/`) - A basic MCP server that listens for client connections, processes commands, and sends responses.

## Running the Example

*   (Instructions to be added here for running both the client and server and observing their interaction.)

## Learning Objectives

*   Understand the basic MCP handshake.
*   See how MCP commands are structured and sent.
*   Observe how MCP responses are received and parsed.
*   Get a feel for client-server communication flow in an MCP system.
